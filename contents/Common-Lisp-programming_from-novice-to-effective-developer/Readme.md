###  Description

Common Lisp is an awesome language. It has pioneered a LOT of concepts in computer science, and while old it is still used in the industry by Big Corps (all quantum computing ones, Google) as well as one-person companies (me!). I'll help you learn it efficiently.

*I am working on new content. If you subscribe now, you'll get the next videos at the same low price.*

*There are subtitles!*

**The sound quality dramatically improved since the beginning.** *The new videos (iteration, projects, conditions…) have perfect audio. I re-recorded the sound of 3 old videos (last update: January, 2023). The sound of some videos have glitches (some remaining in the "functions" chapter). I'll re-record more step by step. Thanks!*

*I publish complementary videos on Youtube. Find the @vindarel channel.*

Lisp the language is different than the Algol/C-like family of languages, and the Lisp development environments still offer unmatched capabilities: interactive, image-based development experience, while getting type warnings and errors at compile time in a fraction of a second, speed in the same group of C, Rust and Java (while sweating less to get to the result), while ensuring stability across decades, etc, etc, etc.

However, you are about to enter a big new world. There are rough edges, the information is sometimes spread apart and hard to discover, despite my continuous work on collaborative resources.

So, I gathered my knowledge and experience of more than five years of continuous reading, tweaking, writing, asking and answering questions, discovering libraries, trial and error, releasing open-source libraries and running commercial applications into this series of videos.

We will learn the language, the tools, the most important pieces of the ecosystem, in order to be able to develop a Common Lisp software from the ground up. We will develop with either Emacs and Slime or the VSCode and Atom editors, we will learn the syntax, we will see all about functions and macros, the CLOS object system, we'll do some web development and we will build binaries and deploy our applications to production servers, etc.

I am genuinely happy to share all that with you in this new video format and I wish you a fun journey.

PS: **pro tip:** if you find a video too slow or if you think you know the content, watch it at speed x1.25 or x1.5. However I recommend to not skip content, as I give tips here and there and inside a section we build on the previous video's content.

###  Who this course is for:
-   Students of computer science who want to discover why Lisp still has un-matched alien technology inside.
-   Young(ish) profesional developers who feel they deserve a more fun, comfy, compiled and fast programming language.
-   Python or JavaScript programmers frustrated by the unstability of their ecosystem.
-   Your friend or colleague.
